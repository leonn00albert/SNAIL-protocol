                <h2>What's Happening?</h2>

                <p>
                    The modern internet has devolved into a tangled mess, overrun by spam, invasive apps,
                    corporate clutter, and government regulations. It's a far cry from the free exchange of ideas it was
                    meant to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Why Snail? </strong>
                </p>
                <p>

                    SnailNet is an acronym that stands for "Staggered Network Access with Inherent Latency." It serves
                    as the fundamental protocol behind SnailNet, enabling communication and sharing in diverse ways.

                    In an era where fast internet speeds often lead to the inundation of mindless and degenerate
                    content, or facilitate invasive tracking by companies, we challenge the myth of faster equating to
                    better. The endless stream of unsatisfactory content is eroding our attention spans to the level of
                    a
                    goldfish. We say no more!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Quality over Quantity </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                <p>
                    Surfing the web has become a challenge. Search engines often deliver SEO-optimized garbage from
                    large corporations that appear to lack both creativity and morals. There's exceptional content out
                    there, but it's buried beneath layers of mediocrity, advertisements, and unimaginative cookie-cutter
                    material.

                    The supposed quality you encounter is nothing more than algorithmically determined gibberish with a
                    singular objective: to prolong your exposure to ads and harvest your data. If you're patient and
                    curious, you'll come to appreciate content that holds genuine value.

                <h2>What is SnailNet?</h2>
                <p>
                    SnailNet is a platform I'm building to create a network that liberates you from centralized systems
                    and frees you from the constraints of any single network. It's designed for independent thinkers and
                    creators like you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To achieve this, we provide a flexible framework that empowers you to create networks in various
                    ways. SnailNet is highly customizable and supports multiple network approaches. Imagine using
                    LoRa-connected devices, establishing a sneakernet, or even experimenting with IP over avian
                    carriers! The core idea is to enable you to actively participate in building and shaping networks,
                    reducing reliance on questionable ISPs and government-monitored networks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    SnailNet comprises these essential elements:

                        peer-to-peer connections.</li>

                <h2>Internet Homesteading</h2>
                <p>
                    I envision the internet more like the wilderness. Here, you are responsible for your own fortune and
                    well-being. You have freedom, but it comes with responsibility. This concept is what I call internet
                    homesteading â€“ where you build what you can, share with others, and trade with others.

                    You don't rely on any larger entity that restricts or monitors what you do. Yes, it requires hard
                    work and learning new skills, but in order to be truly free, you must leave the comforts behind and
                    adapt to what you can carry with you.

                    Trust me, the rewards of your labor will be worth it. The content you'll have will be valuable and
                    meaningful, your connections won't be superficial, and you'll have control over your own piece of
                    digital property.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>To sum up the core philosophy of internet homesteading:</i>

                    <li>Construct your unique digital presence.</li>
                    <li>Cultivate your content.</li>
                    <li>Forge connections with a like-minded community.</li>
                    <li>Pioneer new frontiers of digital expression.</li>

                <h2>How to Get Started?</h2>
                <p>
                    Thank you and congratulations on making it this far! To get started with SnailNet, you can choose
                    one of the following starter packs. Each starter pack contains the core components necessary to use
                    SnailNet, and it includes a README.md file that explains how to further utilize that specific pack.
                    We currently offer four different packs:
                <p>


                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Clients:</strong>
                    This pack includes the starter pages, guides, and a directory of pages that we keep up to date. You
                    can
                    expand your pack by connecting to a node and sending your request. If you prefer, you can also
                    register
                    an address to simplify networking, but please note that this is entirely optional. You should be
                    able to
                    work with randomly assigned addresses and node-specific addresses as well.
